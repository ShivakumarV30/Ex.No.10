## **1. AIM**
The aim of this experiment is to explore how different prompting techniques influence the quality, clarity, structure, and style of AI-generated content. By comparing outputs produced using simple prompts with those generated using refined, structured, and detailed prompts, this experiment evaluates how prompt design affects the final content.

---

## **2. OBJECTIVES**
- To generate initial content using simple/basic prompts.  
- To refine prompts by adding detailed instructions regarding tone, structure, style, and context.  
- To create multiple versions of content to observe how small prompt modifications influence the output.  
- To produce final polished versions for selected topics.  
- To compare differences in quality, creativity, coherence, and factual accuracy across versions.

## **3. METHODOLOGY**

### **Step 1: Selection of Scenarios**
The experiment involves choosing any two content-generation topics from the provided list.

### **Step 2: Use of Simple Prompts**
Basic prompts were used to generate initial drafts. These served as the foundational outputs.

### **Step 3: Refined Prompting**
Prompts were improved by incorporating:
- Structural format (intro–body–conclusion)  
- Key points to be covered  
- Tone requirements  
- Depth and clarity instructions  

### **Step 4: Multiple Versions**
Different writing tones and styles were generated:
- Creative  
- Technical  
- Child-friendly  
- Scientific  
- Emotional  

### **Step 5: Evaluation and Refinement**
Outputs were assessed for:
- Coherence  
- Accuracy  
- Readability  
- Detail level  
- Tone consistency  

Prompts were refined until final outputs were satisfactory.

# **4. IMPLEMENTATION & OUTPUTS**

---

# **SCENARIO 1: EDUCATIONAL REPORT ON RENEWABLE ENERGY**

## **A. First Draft (Simple Prompt)**  

**Prompt:**  
“Write a simple educational report on renewable energy.”

**Output:**  
Renewable energy comes from natural sources like the sun, wind, and water. It reduces pollution and is sustainable. Common examples include solar, wind, and hydropower.

---

## **B. Refined Version (Detailed Prompt)**  

**Prompt:**  
“Create a structured educational report on renewable energy with definition, types, benefits, challenges, and future potential.”

**Output (Shortened):**
- Renewable energy comes from naturally replenishing sources.  
- **Types:** Solar, wind, hydropower, biomass  
- **Benefits:** Low pollution, sustainable supply, job creation  
- **Challenges:** Weather dependency, high initial cost  
- **Future:** Growth expected due to technology and global climate policies  

---

## **C. Multiple Versions (Styles)**

**Creative Style:**  
Renewable energy is nature’s endless gift, offering clean power from the sun, wind, and rivers.

**Technical Style:**  
Renewable systems use photovoltaic, aerodynamic, and hydroelectric technologies for power conversion.

**Child-Friendly Style:**  
Renewable energy comes from the sun, wind, and water—sources that never run out and keep the Earth clean.

---

## **D. Final Polished Output**
Renewable energy is derived from naturally replenishing sources such as sunlight, wind, and water. These clean energy resources help reduce pollution and slow global warming.  
Major types include solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass. Although renewable energy provides sustainability and environmental benefits, it faces challenges like high installation costs and weather dependency.  
With rapid technological advancements, renewable energy is expected to become a major part of the global energy system in the future.

# **SCENARIO 2: ARTICLE ON CLIMATE CHANGE**

## **A. First Draft (Simple Prompt)**  

**Prompt:**  
“Write a simple article on climate change.”

**Output:**  
Climate change occurs due to pollution and deforestation. It causes rising temperatures and extreme weather. We must reduce pollution.

---

## **B. Refined Version (Detailed Prompt)**  

**Prompt:**  
“Write a structured and informative article on climate change with causes, effects, and solutions.”

**Output (Shortened):**
- **Causes:** Fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial emissions  
- **Effects:** Global warming, melting ice caps, extreme weather, sea-level rise  
- **Solutions:** Renewable energy adoption, tree planting, emission reduction  

---

## **C. Multiple Versions (Styles)**

**Emotional Tone:**  
Climate change is reshaping our planet and threatening millions of lives as storms intensify.

**Scientific Tone:**  
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases disrupt Earth’s radiative balance, resulting in long-term climatic shifts.

**Youth-Friendly Tone:**  
Earth is getting hotter because of pollution, affecting animals, weather, and our future.

---

## **D. Final Polished Output**
Climate change is one of the most serious environmental challenges today. It is primarily driven by human activities such as fossil fuel use, industrial processes, and deforestation.  
Its consequences include global warming, melting glaciers, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.  
Addressing climate change requires adopting renewable energy, reducing carbon emissions, protecting forests, and supporting global sustainability initiatives.

---

## **5. RESULT**
The experiment clearly demonstrated that prompt structure and detail level greatly influence AI-generated content.

### **Key Observations**
- Simple prompts produced short, basic, and generic responses.  
- Detailed prompts generated more structured, coherent, and informative outputs.  
- Changing tone or style significantly altered content depth and presentation.  
- Final versions were polished, accurate, and professionally written.
